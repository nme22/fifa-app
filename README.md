# fifa-app
This app will be designed to allow fans to look up their favorite players from various leagues and teams. Similar to FIFA Ultimate team, this app uses the futdb( FIFA ULTIMATE TEAM Database)to find players. These players will be saved with their respective positions, current club, and international origin. Once the players are selected and saved to the user's current team, the user will be able to assign players to roles within a selected formation.

Formations with pulled player data can then be saved within a unique session to ensure a positive user experience!
This app Will use MERN Stack to accomplish these goals.
